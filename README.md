# Tableau-KPI-Visualisation

In this exercise, I am attempting to visualise KPIs in Tableau using different technniques and visualisations. These can be used for your use case accordingly to suit the business need. 

7 different ways

1. KPI values
2. As a bar chart with a reference line for the target/benchmark
3. KPI values + spark line
4. KPI values + spark line and area graph combination
5. KPI values + prior year vs last year as 2 different columns with different widths
6. KPI values + prior year vs current year as a reference line, an indicator for underperforming months in the month name
7. KPI values + prior year vs current year as a reference line, an indicator for underperforming months in the column color
